    "# Automatic Symbolic Equation Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "*Developed by Forough Arabshahi*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the code for the automatic dataset generation scheme presented in [this](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hksj2WWAW&noteId=Hksj2WWAW) paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation generation approach is based on generating new mathematical identities by performing local random changes to known identities, starting with a small number of axioms from the domain under study. These changes result in identities of similar or higher complexity (equal or larger depth), which may be correct or incorrect, that are valid expressions within a grammar. The grammar and its rules are defined in detail in [section 2.1 of the paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hksj2WWAW&noteId=Hksj2WWAW). In this notebook we choose elementary algebra and trigonometry as the domain under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Possible Equations\n",
    "<a id=\"sec:posEq\"></a>\n",
    "In order to generate a new identity which may be correct or incorrect, we select an equation at random from the set of known equations, and make local changes to it. We randomly select a node in the expression tree, followed by randomly selecting one of the following actions to make the local change to the equation at the selected node:\n",
    "* ShrinkNode: Replace the node, if it’s not a leaf, with one of its children, chosen randomly. \n",
    "* ReplaceNode: Replace the symbol at the node (i.e. the terminal or the function) with another\n",
    "compatible one, chosen randomly.\n",
    "* GrowNode: Provide the node as input to another randomly drawn function f , which then\n",
    "replaces the node. If f takes two inputs, the second input will be generated randomly from\n",
    "the set of terminals.\n",
    "* GrowSides: If the selected node is an equality, either add or multiply both sides with a\n",
    "randomly drawn number, or take both sides to the power of a randomly drawn number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented in a function called *genNegEquation*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Additional Correct Equations\n",
    "In order to generate only correct identities, we follow the same intuition as above, but only replace structure with others that are equal. In particular, we maintain a dictionary of valid statements (mathDictionary) that maps a mathematical statement to another. For example, the dictionary key $x + y$ has value $y + x$. We use this dictionary in our correct equation generation process where we look up patterns from the dictionary. More specifically, we look for keys that match a subtree of the equation then replace that subtree with the pattern of the value of the key. E.g. given input equation $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$, this subtree matching might produce equality $\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$ by finding key-value pair $x + y : y + x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented in a function called *genPosEquation*\n",

    "The dependency for this notebook if the [latex2sympy](https://github.com/augustt198/latex2sympy) package which converts a latex equation to sympy. Set the path to latex2sympy in file eqGen.py available in the root folder. Our equations are represented using the *EquationTree* object. The attributes of this object are: \n",
    "1. func: string that stores the function name\n",
    "2. args: list of EquationTree objects that are the children of this node\n",
    "3. varname: string that stores the variable name if the node is a leaf, otherwise this is ''\n",
    "4. number: integer that indicates the node's unique number\n",
    "4. depth: integer that indicates the depth of the subtree that is attached to the node.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the functions are implemented in *eqGen.py*. *readJson* reads an input json in latex format and uses latex2sympy to convert it to a sympy equation. Finally, *buildEq* converts a sympy equation to an EquationTree object. *readAxioms* reads an input txt file and uses the compiler package to convert the equations to a compiler object. Function *parseEquation* then converts this to an EquationTree object. *writeJson* saves the generated EquationTree objects in a json file."
